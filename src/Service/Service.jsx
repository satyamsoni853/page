            <p>Our grassroots programme targets boys and girls aged 6-12 years through school and community initiatives. The key concept of this programme is to bring together as many children as possible and train them using the core human value of exchange, training and practice. We also focus on recreational activities by conducting friendly matches with schools and academies. When kids are seeded with proper training, guidance and values at the root level it enables structured development and growth opportunities.</p>
